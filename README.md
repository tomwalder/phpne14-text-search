# Google App Engine Full Text Search (PHPNE14 Uncon Talk) #

Code for my PHPNE14 20 minute talk.

I wrote this on a train at 05:39, so I apologise in advance for the coding standards.

Also, I'm a novice Python developer.  Flame me @tom_walder

## Running Code ##

## Structure ##

This uses App Engine modules to run (primarily) PHP and Python in the same application "space".

We do this because (at the time of writing) Google don't provide access to Text Search via PHP.

## Wanna try it out yourself? ##

Don't forget to change the "application" in your .yaml files
